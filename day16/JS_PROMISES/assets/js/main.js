// JS: Promises
/*
What is a callback?
What is a Promise?
And finally Async/Await syntax

Asynchronous (Async) is when something is going on but, you don't want to wait
until that process is done and to continiue your program but instead, you want to continue while that processs
is happenning in the background so it's happening asynchronously. Rather than synchronous programming
where something happens and you wait until it's completely finished then you will move to the next.

Asynchronous programming is very relevant to JavaScript because, since javascript is the 
only language that works in browsers, we often make requests to servers elsewhere and it 
can take a couple of seconds to get your data back for instance and you might not want your program
to stall and wait until that request comes back, you wanna keep going and keep doing something. So this 
is where callbacks come in and callbacks were used for a long time until JavaScript ES6 (ES 2015)
was released where promises were introduced to the language. 

And Promises give us a more clear and elegant way to handle asynchronous data. And then in ES7 (Async/Await)
was introduced which you are still dealing with promises but, in a different way, more elegant and simpler way 
and it looks more like synchronous programming or flat rather than using callback chains or .then() again and again
